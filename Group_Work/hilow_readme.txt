This code was created by JR Ogden, Nathan Rowley, Marielle Chiong, and Chris Lynch.

General use:
The program loops through the various classes and functions to create a hilo game. The purpose of the game is to ask the user to guess
if the next card will be higher or lower than the previous card. The user starts out with 300 points and for each correct answer, the user
100 additional points, but for each incorrect answer the user loses 75 points. After each draw, the program will ask the user if they
want to continue to play the game. If the player loses all points, the game will be over and will get the option to play again, where the
points will reset.

Class(es)
There are 3 classes within the program. There is a director, card and player class. Within each class there are multiple functions and
loops to help the user run through the program without any errors.
